                <h5>General Cancer Symptoms:</h5>
                <h6> Very heavy night sweats or fever</h6>
                <p>Sweating at night or having a high temperature (fever) can be caused by infections or a side effect of certain medications. It's also often experienced by women around the time of the menopause. But speak to your doctor if you have very heavy, drenching night sweats, or an unexplained fever.</p>
                <h6>Fatigue</h6>
                <p>There are lots of reasons why you may feel more tired than usual, particularly if you’re going through a stressful event, or having trouble sleeping. But if you’re feeling tired all the time, or, for no clear reason, it could be a sign that something is wrong - speak to your doctor.</p>
                <h6>Unexplained bleeding or bruising</h6>
                <p>Unexplained bleeding or bruising when you have not hurt yourself is important to get checked out by your doctor. This includes blood in your poo or pee, as well as vomiting or coughing up blood. It also includes any unexplained vaginal bleeding between periods, after sex or after the menopause.  No matter how much blood or what colour it is (blood can be red, or a darker colour like brown or black), speak to your doctor.</p>
                <h6>Unexplained pain or ache</h6>
                <p>Pain is one way our body tells us that something is wrong. As we get older, it's more common to experience aches and pains. But unexplained or persistent pain anywhere in the body could be a sign of something more serious.</p>
                <h6>Unexplained weight loss</h6>
                <p>Small weight changes over time are quite normal, but if you have lost a noticeable amount of weight without trying to, tell your doctor.</p>
                <h6>Unusual lump or swelling anywhere</h6>
                <p>Persistent lumps or swelling in any part of your body should be taken seriously. This includes any lumps in the neck, armpit, stomach, groin, chest, breast, or testicle.</p>

                <div>
                It's important to note that many of these symptoms can be caused by conditions other than cancer, but it's essential to have any unusual or persistent symptoms evaluated by a healthcare professional.
